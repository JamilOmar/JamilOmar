Hello :wave: !!
I am from Ecuador(:ecuador:) currently living in the US (:us:)  and I always chase opportunities where I can have new challenges. I have been working as a principal developer and I have been able to participate in all the stages and positions in my current company. I like teaching and helping other team members.
I always like to keep learning and improving our daily tasks with the latest tech trends. And no matter what I always keep a good mood. 

Now, I am currently working in the DevOps team implementing the environments and migrating the pipelines to GitHub Actions. I also have experience as a developer and architect in building new tools/packages for all the current dev teams. Also, I am an entrepreneur, I am a co-founder in MushroomSoft :rocket:, an ecuadorian tech company that provides staff augmentation and tech solutions for customers in US.
